'People living in Halesworth and the surrounding areas are being invited to join the Pear Tree Fund on two special walks to map out the local treasures which help them through tough times.

Called ‘asset walks’, the events will take place on 8 and 15 December starting at 10am in the Throughfare at the entrance to the middle car park.

They have been arranged as part of the Pear Tree Fund’s Compassionate Communities work and will give participants the chance to map the places and spaces, people and pastimes which help them through difficult periods and can improve their quality of life. This could include libraries, health centres, education facilities, leisure centres, cafes, restaurants, bus services, GP practices, shops, faith groups, charities, residents’ associations, support groups, parks and open spaces.

The information they gather will then be used to create an online community treasure map showcasing all of the assets which are available locally to boost wellbeing.'
